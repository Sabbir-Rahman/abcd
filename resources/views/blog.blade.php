                    <p>There are days when we don’t like ourselves. Glancing at the mirror, we invoke self hate instead
                        of self love. Why? Because we think we don’t look “pretty enough”. For a bit of reassurance, we
                        knock our close friends up. Without any sort of hesitation, they will tell you that you are
                        doing enough. Even though external appearance should not be a parameter to judge a person’s
                        worth, as this is bugging you, you are still a very beautiful person. This is exactly what they
                        will tell you. And trust me, they mean it. But our mind loves to question itself. Even after all
                        these appeasing words, we won’t stop with this constant plethora of self-doubt coming at us.</p>
                    <p>Certain notions of this society have stereotyped our minds to believe that only people having a
                        specific set of features can be called beautiful. This set of beauty standards vary from society
                        to society. In the subcontinental culture, the bias towards fair skinned people has become so
                        cliche that now when we talk about it, the bias sounds baseless and somewhat funny. Seems like
                        people have started to finally get out of this bias. But does it mean they have no bias left in
                        them to be inclined to? With the recent surge in pop culture, a new trend of having glass like
                        clear skin has emerged. Having healthy skin is definitely encouraged. But there are some who
                        blindly go at incredible lengths to achieve this target. Failing to achieve the goal, there are
                        many who will eventually start questioning their self-worth. What they forget is the fact that
                        these problems are a part of life. None of this matters so much in the long run as long as your
                        health is there for you.

                <div class="blog__details__text">
                    <p>Despite our bias towards certain beauty standards, an interesting study revealed a completely
                        different perspective. People from different races such as African-American, Masai tribal were
                        given to judge pictures of people based on their beauty. It was ensured that they remain unaware
                        of the hypotheses. All of them judged the pictures based on beauty standards which were accepted
                        across all races and cultures. All of them found blemish free and symmetrical faces prettier.
                        But a different result showed up when they were given pictures of people coming from their same
                        race. Interestingly, they were now biased to the people of their own race and they found their
                        facial features pretty. To reinstate the hypotheses, some university students were brought in
                        pairs. Each pair were friends to each other. Some were same-sex friends and some were from the
                        opposite sex. They had their photographs taken and were then asked to privately rate each
                        other’s attractiveness, along with photos of other participants whom they did not know
                        (strangers). Friends were also asked to rate each other on personality traits, including
                        “admirable,” “generous,” “sensitive,” “warm.” and many more. This led to a similar type of
                        discovery. The friends rated each other’s prettiness on the parameter of how likeable as a
                        person they were, not on the basis of any beauty standard. But while rating strangers, they took
                        factors like facial symmetry and spot free skin as an important factor.</p>
                    <p>From this study, one idea is very clear. We are biased to people’s inner qualities as much as we
                        are biased to the external ones. And the moment we start realizing those internal traits of a
                        person, we no longer care about how they look. They are beautiful to us simply because they are
                        beautiful people. And this is why please believe yourself when your friends tell you that you
                        are beautiful. And ask no more questions.</p>

                        Repetition, one of the essential traits of human life. By doing work repeatedly, we get used to
                        it. Similarly, if you repeat something, people are more likely to believe it, even if it is a
                        rumour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Human beings trust their senses. They believe what they see and hear. After verifying an
                        information, they classify it as truth. But if a false information is provided to him
                        repeatedly, he deems it to be true. It is sometimes called “Illusory Truth Effect”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may think that people who have higher intelligence or knowledge or control of emotion can
                        overcome this effect, but sadly it is not true. This effect is not changed by cognitive
                        ability.But it is not concrete that whatever you hear repeatedly will have permanent effects on
                        you. If anyone tells a person who has just heard the statement that it is false, the effect is
                        lessened. Again, if it is said too much, people will think that it is for persuading
                        them.Lastly, information that is totally faulty cannot affect a person's judgement. For example,
                        “Honey never spoils.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the question is why does it work. We have false information all around us in advertisements,
                        propaganda websites, even small lies heard from a person. We live in a world where information
                        is the key to hold power. But that information is being misinterpreted in many ways. We are
                        always on our toes to protect us from any kind of false information. But why obvious false
                        information feels to be real after hearing it a couple of times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People accept information after processing it in his mind. He verifies it through various
                        sources and completes his justification. But when he hears the false information repeatedly, his
                        mind starts to process it and thinks of it as information from different sources. Even if he
                        does not think it as concrete information, this false information lingers in his mind and this
                        information affects his decisions in every step.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog__item__quote">
                    <p>“The point of modern propaganda isn't only to misinform or push an agenda. It is to exhaust your
                        critical thinking, to annihilate truth.””</p>
                    <span>Garry Kasparov</span>
                </div>
                <div class="blog__details__text">
                    <p>
                        Thus even if a person doesn’t totally believe the information, his processing of a situation
                        becomes defective. This information unifies with his processing, causing a greater incidence.
                        These kinds of incidents increase the encounters of the “Illusory Truth Effect” in the universe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Information shapes our society and culture. People put their beliefs on the system they grew up
                        on. Systems can be easily manipulated by false information. Thus sensitive incidents like voting
                        are being influenced by this “Illusory Truth effect”. Whether a person has set his mind on
                        voting a specific person or not, repeatedly hearing specific information manipulates him from
                        following his own mind. Thus, sensitive issues are being hindered from being processed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if all the logics are not valid, we cannot deny the existence of information that collude
                        us from the accurate scenario. Our mind always influences us to believe what we hear and see.
                        Other peoples’ opinions do not affect us that much. But if an information is being repeatedly
                        given to a person on a golden platter, his mind will begin to play tricks on him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, exposure to a phenomenon always manipulates a person’s judgement. For example, Being
                        constantly exposed to a certain religion, will make him a little easy about that religion’s
                        culture. Thus he starts to become familiar with its customs. Similarly, constantly feeding on
                        information makes him believe in all the incidents that happen for that particular information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe, humankind, as an existence, is not just in all the judgments. But it can be the proper
                        way for that particular time frame. It's not the judgements that affect the time and space, it's
                        the consequences.

                        Discrimination, racism, inequality, oppression, exploitation, ignorance, silence -
                        the list will go on. We do not live in a utopian society. To ensure rights and make
                        the world a better place to live, we need to raise our voice, point out issues and
                        fight to achieve the goal. Activism embodies the policies and actions taken in such
                        cases. Activists work for the greater good and strive to represent the people
                        whose voices remain unheard or neglected. From climate change to the Black
                        Lives Matter movement and LGBTQ rights movement, we have seen activists
                        continue their battle against the existing policy, perspective, or action. Their
                        creative strategy aims to change public perception of any issue by making it
                        mainstream, forcing robust conversations, and reframing the standards of what is
                        acceptable and what not.

                        The word activism resembles the practice of taking action to bring a change.
                        Specifically, activism refers to the successive effort to promote, direct or prevent
                        actions towards a political or social change. Activists advocate and practice
                        activism. They cover a broad spectrum of issues, including political, social,
                        economic, and environmental policies and actions. Tracing back, we see a vibrant
                        history of activists around the world. From Malala Yousafzai and Anna Hazare to
                        Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Nelson Mandela – the list of
                        activists proudly contains some of the most remarkable and persuading names.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no solid structure for activists. They fight for different issues in different
                        ways around the globe. Sometimes, they raise a global voice to form a stronger
                        movement. In recent years, we have encountered different types of activism.
                        Activists choose their preferable platform and build a creative action plan for their
                        issue. Demonstrations, boycotts, strikes, petitions, online and offline campaigns
                        are some forms of activism. It encourages the cultivation of societal alternatives
                        and assists in reforming the structure. Activism leads towards more inclusion and
                        making the world more equitable.

                    <p>
                        The contribution of activism in society is outstanding. Activism fought for
                        women&#39;s right to vote. We found activists fighting against racial discrimination.
                        They ensured the cancellation of adverse laws in different parts of the world.
                        Activism empowers people to talk about issues and breaks the silence.
                        Superstition and stigmatization hinder natural growth from various aspects as

                        they impose barriers. Activism has a long history of battling against them.
                        Smashing the glass ceiling, now we can dream bigger.

                        Reviewing recent events, we may get a better picture of activism. #MeToo
                        became the voice of survivors of sexual harassment. People saw the darker side of
                        the glamorous world. During Hong Kong&#39;s protest against plans to allow
                        extradition to mainland China, activists drew global attention through their
                        actions. The Black Lives Matter movement started to stand against police brutality
                        and all racially motivated violence. Activists created a worldwide response and
                        support. If we consider activists to become the face of a movement, Malala
                        Yousafzai is an obvious example. For publicly speaking about education for girls,
                        terrorists shot her. Still, she continued to dream as an education activist. Swedish
                        environmental activist Greta Thunberg is internationally known for challenging
                        world leaders to take immediate action for climate change mitigation. In the age
                        of social media, activism reached a new height.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Day by day, activism is receiving more audiences and active supporters. The
                        participation of both older and younger people with their issues is leading
                        activism to a different dimension. Activism allows us to learn about our life,
                        society, and history from a better perspective. So, we get to realize who is
                        exploiting and how. Young climate activists grabbed our attention and
                        encouraged us to rethink our approach towards the environment. When we see
                        school students are coming out to strike for climate change, it points out how our
                        existing system failed to assure them about their future. On the other hand, we
                        realize, our next generation is considering the wellbeing of our mother earth. It
                        helps us to be optimistic about the future.
                        As activism serves our crying needs, it has turned into a powerful tool for
                        accelerating development. For better tomorrow, an upward spiral of activism is
                        vital.
