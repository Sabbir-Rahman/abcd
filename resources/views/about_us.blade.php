                                a pivotal event that marks the beginning of the journey that the freshers will embark.
                                And what better way to start a journey than reliving the brilliant past of your new home
                                with your new family and of course donuts. In this event the seniors debate among
                                themselves on eccentric topics of interest and the most logically humorous team takes
                                home the trophy. Cafe Debate is a platform for the freshers to get mesmerized by the
                                charisma of the debaters of IUTDS and seeing such glamour they too get inspired and
                                aspire to be on the stage as soon as they can. People come into this event just to see
                                what’s IUTDS all about only to fall in love and stay. “Come for the Donut. Stay for the
                                Debate”

                                Cafe Debate is hosted every year on Club Fresher’s Day simply for fun. The seniors
                                debate among themselves on eccentric topics of interest and the most logically humorous
                                team takes the trophy home. This fun debate works as a great tool for breaking the ice
                                between the freshers and the seniors of the club.
